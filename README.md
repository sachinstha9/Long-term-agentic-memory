# Long-Term Agentic Memory Practice

This is a repository where I practiced building long-term memory agents using **LangGraph**, based on the [Long-Term Agentic Memory with LangGraph](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/long-term-agentic-memory-with-langgraph/) course by DeepLearning.AI.

I used **Python**, **LangGraph**, and **LangChain** to implement memory handling and agent workflows.
